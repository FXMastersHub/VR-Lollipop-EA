VR Lollipop EA is an automated Forex robot created by Vladimir Pastushak. It identifies and follows market trends, opening and managing trades automatically on MT4/MT5. Its logic is built around smart, cycle-based trend trading

## 💱 Currency Pair / Timeframe / Platform

- Pairs: Works on major Forex pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, USDCHF, etc.) but can be used on most assets
- Timeframe: Best on hourly charts (H1), though flexible on other timeframes.
- Platform: Compatible with MetaTrader 4 & 5, with identical features across both

## ✨ Highlights

- Trend-following design: builds trades in the direction of the market.
- Unique “floating trailing” stops using percentage instead of points
- Cycles: opens pairs, secures breakeven, then starts a new cycle
- Paired positions: starts with two opposite orders, keeps the profitable side

## ⚙️ Settings / Features

- Spread filter: stops trading when spread is too high.
- Lot sizing: fixed, percentage of balance, or balance-level based.
- Lot multiplier and reduction for scaling positions.
- Distance options: in points, percent, Bollinger Bands, bar average
- Breakeven settings: auto moves SL to entry price once safe.
- Trailing stops: manual or dynamic (based on trend size percent)
- Notifications via MT alerts, mobile, email, or Telegram.

## 🔄 How It Works

- EA opens two opposite trades (a hedged pair).
- As price moves, it closes the “wrong way” trade and keeps the trend-following one.
- It scales into the trend using lot multipliers.
- Once safe (SL at breakeven), it triggers a new cycle instead of opening more

## 🎯 Key Benefits

- Once safe (SL at breakeven), it triggers a new cycle instead of opening more
- Risk protection: breakeven and smart sl settings keep drawdowns controlled.
- Trend optimization: scales into strong trends, maximizing profits.
- High customizability: lets you tweak spread, lot size, trailing style, and more.
- Multi-platform support: works on both MT4 and MT5.

## ✅ Why Choose

- Combines trend detection, scaling, and smart risk management in one system.
- Its dynamic trailing stop prevents small pullbacks from closing positions prematurely
- Real forward-testing with reported gains of 500%+ in demo accounts over months

## 💡 Conclusion

VR Lollipop EA is a well-engineered tool for traders who prefer automated trend-following with built-in risk controls. Its blend of paired entry, dynamic stops, and cycle-based trading makes it a strong choice for consistent intraday performance. Ideal for those comfortable setting and tweaking EA parameters, and wanting a system that adapts to live market moves.
